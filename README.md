# About

This app serves as a replacement for the very broken Aeries mobile dashboard app. Please note it is still in development and features may be missing.

# Privacy
**Are my grades private?**

Yes, your password, grades, and other sensitive information is kept on-device. We believe privacy is incredibly important. The app securely encrypts all stored secrets on-device through the official Apple Keychain. Then, the app directly requests your information from the Aeries server as it would be if you were loading the website. All code is open-source so it can be audited by third parties.
